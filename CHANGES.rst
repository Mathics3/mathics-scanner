CHANGES
=======

1.1.2
-----

Release 1.1.1 introduced a small bad interaction with Mathics and the
unicode infix form of ``Function[]``.

In our master table, when there is a unicode operator like there is for "Function",
(uF4A1), the operator name to be YAML key name.

There is an alternate ASCII Function operator ``&``. And for that we
used the name Function which precluded using it for the unicode, where
it is mandiatory. For ASCII operators it isn't necessary, but still
nice to do when there is no conflict.

1.1.1
-----

* Finish adding operator names.
* Generate ``IndentingNewline`` (``\n``) properly in GNU Readline inputrc tables.
* Adjust expectation on test since there can be duplicate function operators (for ``Apply`` and ``Function``).

1.1.0
-----

* Add operator-name, and ASCII fields. See named-characters.yml for a description of these
* Add some whitespace characters like IndentingNewLine and RawReadLine
* Improve testing
* Fix some small tagging based on testing
* Add unicode-to-operator generation

Note: not all operators have been tagged, so expect another release soon when that's done.


1.0.0
-----

* The scanner split off from Mathics3.
* Tables added for converting between WL names and Unicode, ASCII and character properties. See ``implementation.rst`` for details.
* Code and docstring gone over.

See git in Mathics before Jan 18, 2021 for old history of these files.
