Mathics Character Tables and Scanner
=====================================

This repository really contains two things:

* extensive tables describing WL symbols, operators, and their properties
* a tokenizer or scanner portion for the Wolfram Language.

With respect to the first item, there are two commented YAML files that contain a
full set of translation between:

* Wolfram Language named characters,
* Unicode/ASCII equivalents and Unicode and WL code-points,
* AMSLaTeX equivalent names,
* Operator name (if symbol is an operator),
* Operator arity (if an operator)
* Operator precedence (if an operator)
* Operator associativity (if an operator)
* Keyboard escape sequences for the symbol

Uses
----

The scanner and character tables are used inside `Mathics <https://mathics.org>`_. However information can
also be used by other programs for tokenizing and formatting Wolfram Language code.

For example, tables are used in `mathics-pygments <https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-Scanner/>`_, a Pygments-based
lexer and highlighter for Mathematica/Wolfram Language source code.

This library may be useful if you need to work with Wolfram Language
named character and convert them to various formats.

Usage
-----

- For tokenizing and scanning Wolfram Language code, use the
  ``mathics_scanner.tokenizer.Tokenizer`` class.
- To convert between Wolfram Language named characters and Unicode/ASCII, use
  the ``mathics_scanner.characters.replace_wl_with_plain_text`` and
  ``mathics_scanner.characters.replace_unicode_with_wl`` functions.
- To convert between qualified names of named characters (such ``FormalA`` for
  ``\[FormalA]``) and Wolfram's internal representation use the
  ``mÌ€athics_scanner.characters.named_characters`` dictionary.

To regenerate JSON-format tables run:

::

   $ mathics3-generate-json-table
   $ mathics3-generate-operator-json-table

Without options ``mathics3-generate-json-table`` produces the maximum set of correspondences.

In most applications though you may need just a few of these. The
``--field`` option can be used to narrow the list of entries to output in JSON. Run
``mathics3-generate-json-table --help`` for a full list of fields.


Utility for showing token parsing
---------------------------------

There is a command-line utility, ``mathics3-tokens`` for showing how
an input stream is tokenized. The ``--CodeTokenize`` or ``-C`` option
will try to show the token as it would appear using CodeTokenize. type
``mathics3-tokens --help`` information on command-line options.

Implementation
--------------

For notes on the implementation of the packages or details on the conversion
scheme please read `Implementation <https://mathics-scanner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementation.html>`_.
