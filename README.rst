Mathics3 Character Tables and Scanner
=====================================

This repository really contains two things:

* extensive tables describing WL symbols, operators, and their properties
* a tokenizer or scanner portion for the Wolfram Language.

Concerning the first item, there are two commented YAML files that contain a
full set of translations between:

* Wolfram Language named characters,
* Unicode/ASCII equivalents and Unicode and WL code-points,
* AMSLaTeX equivalent names,
* Operator name (if symbol is an operator),
* Operator arity (if an operator)
* Operator precedence (if an operator)
* Operator associativity (if an operator)
* Keyboard escape sequences for the symbol

Uses
----

The scanner and character tables are used inside `Mathics3 <https://mathics.org>`_. However information can
also be used by other programs for tokenizing and formatting Wolfram Language code.

For example, tables are used in `mathics-pygments <https://pypi.org/project/Mathics3-pygments/>`_, a Pygments-based
lexer and highlighter for Mathematica/Wolfram Language source code.

This library may be useful if you need to work with the Wolfram Language
named character and convert it to various formats.

Usage
-----

- For tokenizing and scanning Wolfram Language code, use the
  ``mathics_scanner.tokenizer.Tokenizer`` class.
- To convert between Wolfram Language named characters and Unicode/ASCII, use
  the ``mathics_scanner.characters.replace_wl_with_plain_text`` and
  ``mathics_scanner.characters.replace_unicode_with_wl`` functions.
- To convert between qualified names of named characters (such ``FormalA`` for
  ``\[FormalA]``) and Wolfram's internal representation use the
  ``m̀athics_scanner.characters.named_characters`` dictionary.

To regenerate JSON-format tables, run:

::

   $ bash admin-tools/make-JSON-tables.sh

Utility for showing token parsing
---------------------------------

There is a command-line utility, ``mathics3-codeparser-tokenize``, for showing how
an input stream is tokenized. The ``--CodeTokenize`` or ``-C`` option
will try to show the token similar to how it would appear using the ``CodeParser`CodeTokenize``. Type
``mathics3-codeparser-tokenize --help`` information on command-line options.

Implementation
--------------

For notes on the implementation of the packages or details on the conversion
scheme, please read `Mathics3 scanner's documentation <https://mathics3-scanner-and-yaml-tables-for-characters-and-operators.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or
`Scanning section <https://mathics-development-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-overview/scanning.html>`_ of the Mathics3 User and Developers Guide.
