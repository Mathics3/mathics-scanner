Mathics Scanner
===============

This is the tokeniser or scanner portion for the Wolfram Language.

As such also contains a full set of translation between WL Character names, their Unicode names and code points,
and other character metadata such as whether the character is "letter like".

Uses
====

This is used as the scanner inside `Mathics <https://mathics.org>`_ but it can also be used for tokenizing and formatting WL code. In fact we intend to write one.
