# Information about Wolfram Language grouping characters.
#

# Following WMA terminology, we use "Left", and "Right" for opening
# and closing delimiters. We also use "TeX" (as opposed to LaTeX, or
# AMSLaTeX) in field names since the concept works equally well in all
# forms of TeX. (This is not the situation in named-characters.yml for
# AMSLaTeX symbols.)

# All of the key names *except* Parenthesis should be a valid operator
# name.

#
# Fields
# ======
#

# ASCII-Left (string)
# -------------------
# The left-most or opening character(s) in ASCII.

# ASCII-Right (string)
# -------------------
# The right-most or closing character(s) in ASCII.

# TeX-Left (string)
# -----------------
# The left-most or opening character(s) in either TeX and variants
# (LaTeX, AMSLaTeX).

# TeX-Right (string)
# -------------------
# The right-most or closing character(s) in either TeX and variants
# (LaTeX, AMSLaTeX).

# Unicode-Left (string)
# ---------------------
# The left-most or opening character(s) in Unicode.

# Unicode-Right (string)
# ----------------------
# The right-most or closing character(s) in Unicode.

#
# is-resizable (boolean)
# ----------------------
# If true, then character(s) are resizable in TeX using \left or
# \right. Note that if there is more than one (ASCII) character both
# characters need to be prefaced with \left or \right.
#
# Right now, all grouping symbols are resizable, but we'll make this
# explicit in case there is one pops up that is not resizable.

# Note that font changing can be used as well via: \bigr, \bigl,
# \Bigl, \Bigr, \biggl, \biggr, \Biggl, or \Biggr.

# AngleBracket is an operator with no built-in meaning
AngleBracket:
  Unicode-Left: '\[LeftAngleBracket]'

Association:
  ASCII-Left: "<|"
  ASCII-Right: "|>"

  is-resizable: true

# Note DoubleVerticalBar which sort of looks like DoubleBracketingBar
# is an *infix* operator with no built-in meaning.

  Left: "{" # <- sharp added to make viewing in Emacs highlight work
  Right: "}"
  is-resizable: true
